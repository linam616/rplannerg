What problem is your project trying to solve? :
(Given infinite time and resources what is the ideal form of this idea? Also include the fundamental hypothesis of this idea - what assumption are you basing this idea on.) 

The project is a college planner designed mainly for UIUC students that keeps track of course requirements, exams/quizzes, overall health summary, and events/reminders 
Bases it off an RPG style game that rewards you for keeping track of your schedule and well being
Hypothesis: Hybrid between a general college planner and RPG style game that incorporates a student’s daily schedule and provides a reward system for following through with course requirements and routine schedule

-Includes the course requirements you still need to graduate
-Be able to contain and maintain a wide range of tasks whether it is daily tasks, upcoming tests/exams, or one’s well being. 
-Rewards you for consistently following through with your planner. However, it doesn’t punish you for missing out on days, so you’re merely missing out on the opportunity to play more in the RPG
